# Cryptoeconomics
It is difficult to find resources on cryptoeconomics. Most of the people who are expert
are too busy to write much of it down! This repo should help out a bit. 

#### Some goals:
1. Serve as a list of resources & information on cryptoeconomics
2. Provide a space where crypto projects can be rigorously analyzed
